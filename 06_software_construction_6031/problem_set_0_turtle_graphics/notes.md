***git init***
<br>creates a new Git repository, it can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository. 
<br>***@param***
<br>it's a tag/doc comment, used whithin Javadoc, a tool that helps generate API documentation for java code. 
<br>**@return**
<br>it's a tag, it is used to complete the execution of a method, and required for every method that return something other than void, even if it's redundant with the method description.

<br>`public static void main(String[] args)` is the entry point for Java programs.

<br>**Unit testing**
- A major component of the 6.005 design philosophy is to decompose problems into minimal, orthogonal units, which can be assembled into the larger modules that form the finished program. 
- One benefit of this approach is that each unit can be tested thoroughly, independently of others, 
- so that faults can be quickly isolated and corrected as code is rewritten and modules are configured.
- Unit testing is the technique of writing tests for the smallest testable pieces of functionality, to allow for the flexible and organic evolution of complex, correct systems. 
- By writing thoughful unit tests, it is possible to verify the *correctness* of one's code, and to be confident that the resulting programs behave as expected.
