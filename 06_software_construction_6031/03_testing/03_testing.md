## Reading 3: Testing

<br>***Objective***
<br>After today's class, you should:
- understand the value of testing, and know the process of test-first programming;
- be able to suite a test suite for correctness, thoroughness, and size;
- be able to design a test suite for a method by partitioning its input space and choosing good test cases;
- be able to judge a test suite by measuring its code coverage;
- understand and know when to use black box vs. glass box testing, unit tests vs. integration tests, and automated regression testing. 
  
**Validation**
<br>*Testing is an example of a more general process called **validation***. 
<br>The *purpose* of validation is to uncover problems in a program and thereby increase your confidence in the program's correctness. (Correctness: *one that does exactly what its designers and users intend it to do â€“ no more and no less.* )

<br>Validation includes: 
- **Formal reasoning** about a program: usually called verfication, it constructs a formal proof that a program is correct. 
- **Code review**, it will be discussed in the next reading class. 
- **Testing**: running the program on carefully selected inputs and checking the results. 

<br>Even with the best validation, it's very hard to achieve perfect quality in software. 
<br>Here are some typical residual defect rates (bugs left over after the software has shipped) per kloc (one thousand lines of source code): 

- 1 - 10 defects/kloc: Typical industry software.
- 0.1 - 1 defects/kloc: High-quality validation. The Java libraries might achieve this level of correctness. 
- 0.01 - 0.1 defects/kloc: The very best, safety-critical validation. Nasa and companies like Praxis can achieve this level. 

<br>*Example*: 
<br>If you have shipped a million lines of typical industry source code (1 defect/kloc), it means you missed 1000 bugs! 

**Why software testing is hard**

*Here are some approaches that unfortunately don't work well in the world of software:*

- **Exhaustive testing** is infeasible, the space of possible test cases is generally too big to cover exhaustively. 
- **Haphazard testing** is *less likely to find bugs*, unless the program is so buggy that an arbitrarily-chosen input is more likely to fail than to succeed. It also doesn't increase our confidence in program correctness. 
- **Random or statistical testing** doesn't work well for software, as in physical systems. Software behavior varies discontinuously and discretely across the space of possible inputs, the system may seem to work fine across a broad range of inputs, and then abruptly fail at a single boundary point. 

*Instead, test cases must be chosen carefully and systematically.*

*Testing all inputs is not feasible, beacuse even one 64-bit floating point number has 2^64 possible values, which is more than age of the universe in microseconds*

**Test-first programming**
- **Module**, it's a part of a software system that can be designed, implemented, tested, and reasoned about separately from the rest of the system. 
  - *in this reading, we'll focus on modules that are functions, represented by java methods, in future readings, we'll broaden our view to think about larger modules, like a class with multiple interacting mehods.*
- **Specification/spec**, it describes the behavior of a module. 
  - for a function, the specification gives *the types of the parameters and any additional constraits on them*, it also gives *the type of the return value and how the return value relates to the inputs*, in Java code, *the specification consists of the method signature and the comment above it that describes what it does.*
- a module has an **implementation**, that provides its behavior, and clients that use the module. 
  - for a function, *the implementation is the body of the method*, an the clients are other code that calls the method, *the specification of the module constrains both the client and the implementation*. 
- a **test case** is a particular choice of inputs, along with the expected output behavior required by the specification. 
- a **test suite** is a set of test cases for a module. 

**This is a good pattern to follow when designing a program from scratch, in test-first programming, you write the spec and the tests before you even write any code, the development of a single functions proceeds in this order:**
- **Spec**: write a specification for the function. 
- **Test**: write tests that exercise the specification. 
- **Implement**: write the implementation. 
<br>***Once your implementation passes the tests you wrote, you're done.***

<br>*The biggest benefit of test-first programming is safety from bugs*. 
<br>Don't leave testing until the end of development, when you have a big pile of unvalidated code. *Leaving testing until the end only makes debugging longer and more painful, because bugs may be anywhere in your code.*
<br>It's far more pleasant to test your code as you develop it. 

*some notes*: 
- *method signature consists of the method's name, parameter types, and return type, which are all part of the specification.*
- *every test case is a ***client*** of the module.*

**Systematic testing**
<br>Rather than exhaustive, haphazard, or randomized testing, we want to test *systematically*.
<br>Systematic testing means that we are choosing test cases in a principled way, with the goal of designing a test suite with three desirable properties: 
- **Correct**, *a correct test suit is a legal client of the specification*, and *it accepts all legal implementations of the spec without any complaint.*
  - *This give us the freedom to change how the module is implemented internally without necessarily having to change the test suite.* 
- **Thorough**, a thorough test suite *finds actual bugs* in the implementation, caused by mistakes that programmers are likely to make. 
- **Small**, *a small test suite, with few test cases*, is faster to write in the first place, *and easier to update if the specification evolves*.
  - Small test suites are alse faster to run, you will be able to run your tests more frequently if your test suites are small and fast. 

<br>By these criteria, exhaustive testing is thorough but infeasibly large, haphazard testing tends to be small but not thorough, randomized testing can achieve thoroughness only at the cost of large size. 
<br>You have to make the test suite design wanting to make your code fail, *test-first programming* allows you to put on your testing hat, and adopt that brutal perspective, before you've even written any code. 

**examples**:
- A test suite is *correct* if: all its test cases pass when run on a legal implementation (failing on buggy implementations is also desirable, of course, but that is thoroughness, not correctness).
- A test suite T1 is more thorough than a test suite T2 if: the buggy implementations that fail at least one test in T1 is a strict superset of those that fail at least one test in T2 (if T1 rejects a superset of buggy implementations compared to T2, the T1 is more thorugh than T2), (redundant test cases might be larger, but they find the same bugs, accept more legal implementations means to be correct not thorough).
- An empty test suite contains no test cases. Assuming a nontrivial specification, an empty test suite is: correct and small, but not thorough, it might passes all legal implementations and be as small as possible, but it alse passes buggy implementations, so it is not thorough. 

**Choosing test cases by partitioning**
<br>We want to pick a set of test cases that is small enough to be easy to write and maintain and quick to run, yet thorough enough to find bugs in the program. 
<br>**Todo this**: 

- <ins>we divide the input space into subdomains, each consisting of a set of inputs</ins>
- <ins>taken together, the subdomains form a partition:</ins> 
- <ins>a collection of disjoint sets that completely covers the input space</ins> 
- <ins>so that every input lies in exactly one subdomain</ins> 
- <ins>then we choose one test case from each subdomain, and that's our test suite</ins> 

<br>*test case = particular choice of inputs* * / subdomains are not the same as test cases. 
<br>*subdomains* = are set inputs from which test cases are chosen.
<br>*test suit = set of test cases* * 
- The idea behind subdomains is to dived the input space into sets of similar inputs on which the program has similar behavior.
- Then we use one representative of each set.
- *a partition* must completely cover the set of possible inputs.
  
*This approach makes the best use of limited testing resources by choosing dissimilar test cases, and forcing the testing to explore areas of the input space that random testing might not reach.*

<br>**example 1**:

```
/**
 * ...
 * @param a  an argument
 * @param b  another argument
 * @return the larger of a and b.
 */
public static int max(int a, int b)
```
<br>`max int x int -> int`
- We have a two-dimensional *input space*, consisting of all the pairs of integers (a,b), now let's partition it: 
- from the specification, it makes sense to choose the subdomains: `{(a,b)|a < b} and {(a,b)|a > b}`
- but we can't stop there, because these subdomains are not yet a partition of the input space 
- ***a partition must completely cover the set of possible inputs***, so we need to add `{(a,b)|a = b}`
<br>Expressed compactly, the partition looks like this: `// partition: a < b; a > b; a = b`
<br>Out test suite might the be: 
- `(a,b) = (1,2) to cover a < b`
- `(a,b) = (10,-8) to cover a > b`
- `(a,b) = (9,9) to cover a = b`

**example 2**:
<br>*suppose you want to partition the input space of this integer square root function*
```
/**
 * @param x   must be nonnegative
 * @returns nearest int to the square root of x
 */
public static int sqrt(int x)
```
Evaluate the quality of each of the following candidate partitions 
- Are the proposed subdomains disjoint and complete, thus forming a partition? 
- Are they correct, in the sense that each subdomain can be covered by a legal test case? 
<br>*A good partition should check all three boxes*
<br>`// partition: x < 0; x >= 0` *(subdomains are: disjoint and complete, not correct)*.
- The proposed subdomains are disjoint, and their union covers the input space of the function, so they form a partition.
- But x < 0 is not a correct subdomain because it consists entirely of ilegal inputs, so it would not be possible ot choose a correct test case to cover this subdomain.
<br>`// partition: x is a pefect square; x is an integer > 0 but not a perfect square` *(subdomains are: disjoint, complete, correct).*
- The two proposed subdomains are disjoint. 
- Their union covers the input space of the function (including 0, which is a perfect square).
- They include no ilegal inputs, so they form a correct partition.
- This is likely to be useful partition, in the sense of separating inputs with different behavior, because the function returns an exact answer on the first subdomain but a rounded answer on the second.
<br>`// partition: x = 0, x = 1, x = 7, x = 16` *(subdomains are: disjoint, correct, not complete).*
- These four proposed subdomains are singleton sets, which are disjoint but do not completely cover the input space. 
- All of them are correct inputs.
- This example looks like a set of candidate test cases that have been proposed as a partition, which is a common confusion. 
- ***Subdomains are not the same as test cases.***
- ***Subdomains are sets of inputs from which test cases are chosen.***
- Some subdomains may be singletons (like boundary values), but most are not.

<br>**example 3:**
```
/**
 * @param x an integer
 * @param y an integer, where x and y are not both 0
 * @return the greatest common divisor of x and y
 */
public static int gcd(int x, int y);
```
`// partition: x and y are not both 0` *(subdomains are: disjoint, complete, correct).*
- This is a single subdomain, `{(x,y)| x and y are not both 0}`
- This is indeed a partition, because it covers the entire domain, but it's unlikely to be useful for producing a thotough test suite, however.
<br>`// partition: x is divisible by y; y is divisible by x; x and y are relatively prime` *(subdomains are: correct, but not disjoint, complete).*
- The three subdomains are not disjoint, for example, any point such that x = y belongs to both of the first two, and x = y = 1 belongs to all three. 
- The subdomains are not complete because they don't cover a point like x = 6, y = 8, where x and y are not relatively prime but also neither is a factor of the other.
- The subdomains are, however, correct, because each one contains at least one legal test case. 
- This partition could be imporved into a complete disjoint, and useful partition for gcd

**Include boundaries in the partition**
- *A **boundary** value is a data value that corresponds to a minimum or maximum input, internal, or output value specified for a system or component.*
- *Bugs often occur at boundaries between subdomains.*
  - 0 is a boundary between positive numbers and negative numbers. 
  - the maximum and minimum values of numeric types, like int or double.
  - emptiness for collection types, like the empty string, empty list, or empty set, (for example empty string) 
  - the first and last element of a sequence, like a string or list. 
  
<br>**Example 1:**
```
/**
 * @param winsAndLosses  a string of length at most 5 consisting of 'W' or 'L' characters
 * @return the fraction of characters in winsAndLosses that are 'W'
 */
double winLossRatio(String winsAndLosses);
```
Boundaries: 
- `""`, the empty string is always a good boundary value, as are other minimums like 0 or the empty list
- `"LLLLL"` and `WWWWW`, maximums also produce good boundary values, in this case, maximizing the number of W characters, and also maximizing the number of L characters

**Example 2, BigInteger.multiply**
```
// specification: 
/**
 * @param val another BigInteger
 * @return a BigInteger whose value is (this * val).
 */
public BigInteger multiply(BigInteger val)
```
For example, here's how it might be used: 
```
BigInteger a = new BigInteger("9500000000"); // 9.5 billion
BigInteger b = new BigInteger("2");
BigInteger ab = a.multiply(b); // should be 19 billion
```
This method is using the self-object as a second parameter, although there is only one parameter explicitly shown in the method's declaration, *multiply is actually a function of two arguments:* the object you're calling the method on `a`, and the parameter that you're passing in the parenthesses `b`.
<br>`multiply: BigInteger x BigInteger -> BigInteger`
- We have a two-dimensional input space, consisting of all the pairs of integers (a,b)
- Thinking about how *sign rules* work with multiplication, *we might start with these subdomains*:
  - a and b are both positive 
  - a and b are both negative 
  - a is positive, b is negative 
  - a is negative, b is positive
  
- There are also some boundary values for multiplication that we should check: 
  - a or b is 0, because the result is always 0
  - a or b is 1, the identity value for multiplication 

- Finally, because the purpose of BigInteger is to represent arbitrarily-large integers, we should make sure to try integers that are very big, at least bigger than the biggest *long*, which is roughly 2<sup>63</sup>, a 19-digit decimal integer
  - a or b is small or large in magnitude, (small enough to represent in a *long* value, or too large for a long)

<br>Let's bring all these observations together into a single partition of the whole (a,b) space, we'll choose a and b independently from: 
- 0
- 1
- small positive integer (â‰¤ Long.MAX_VALUE and > 1)
- small negative integer (â‰¥ Long.MIN_VALUE and < 0)
- large positive integer (> Long.MAX_VALUE)
- large negative integer (< Long.MIN_VALUE)

<br>***so this would produce 6 x 6 = 36 subdomains that pastition the space of pairs of integers***
<br>***to produce the test suite from this partition, we would pick an arbitrary pair (a,b) from each square of the grid:***

- (a,b) = (0, 0) to cover (0, 0)
- (a,b) = (0, 1) to cover (0, 1)
- (a,b) = (0, 8392) to cover (0, small positive integer)
- (a,b) = (0, -7) to cover (0, small negative integer)
- â€¦
- (a,b) = (-1060, -10810) to cover (large negative, large negative)

**Using multiple partitions**
<br>For functions with multiple parameters, this can become costly.
