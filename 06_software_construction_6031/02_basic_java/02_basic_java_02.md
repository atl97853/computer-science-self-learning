**Snapshot diagrams**
<br>Snapshot diagrams represent the internal state of a program at runtime, its stack/on the call stack(methods in progress an their local variables) ant its heap(objects that currently exist).

**Mutating values vs. reassigning variables**
<br>Mutating values:
- Mutation refers to directly modifying the value stored withing a variable.
- The variable itself cotinues to point to the same piece of memory, but the content of that memory location is changed. 

<br>Reassigning variables: 
- Reassignment involves creating a new association between a variable name and a value. 
- Pointing the variable to a different piece of memory holding a new value. 
```
int x = 10; // x points to a box with value 10 (primitive)

// Mutation (changing the value in the same box)
x = 20;  // Now x points to the same box, but the value is 20

String name = "Alice";  // name points to a box with the String "Alice" (object)

// Reassignment (pointing name to a different box with a new value)
name = "Bob";  // Now name points to a completely different box with the String "Bob"
```
**call-by-value**
```
void f(String s, StringBuilder sb) {
  s.concat("b"); 
  // because the fresh string that the .concat() method is assign it to nothing, that's why the value of s doesn't change at all.
  s += "c";
  sb.append("d");
}
String t = "a";
StringBuilder tb = new StringBuilder(t);
f(t, tb);
```
<br>This kind of parameter-passing behavior is referred to as call-by-value, because the parameter receives an initial value from the caller, but then the parameter can be freely reassigned without affecting the caller.

**== vs. esquals**
<br>`x and y -> String "abc" | z -> String "abc"`
<br>Example:
- x.equals(y): returns true because x and y have the same characters
- x == y: returns true because x and y point to the same object
- x.equals(z): returns true because x and z have the same characters
- x == z: returns false because x and z point to different objects

<br>As a general rule:
- Use == for comparing primitive values, like ints, chars, and doubles.
- Use equals() for comparing object values, like lists, arrays, strings, and other objects.
- Using equals() on primitive types is fortunately easy to catch. 5.equals(5) produces a static error because Java doesnâ€™t allow calling any method on a primitive type.

**Java Collections**
<br>A list contains an ordered collection of zero or more objects, where the same object might appear multiple times. We can add and remove items to and from the List, which will grow and shrink to accomodate its contents.

<-> *add all the methods later* <->

**Generics: declaring List, Set, and Map variables**
- *A generic type is an object-oriented type (class or interface) that accepts one or more type parameters, allowing the class to defer the specification of such parameters until the class is declared and instantiated by a client (user) of the class.*

<br>In Java we can restrict the type of objects contained in the collection. When we add an item, the compiler can perform static checking to ensure we only add items of the appropriate type. Then, when we pull out an item, we are guaranteed that its type will be what we expect.
<br>Here's the syntax for declaring some variables to hold collections:
```
List<String> cities;        // a List of Strings
Set<Integer> numbers;       // a Set of Integers
Map<String,Turtle> turtles; // a Map with String keys and Turtle values
```
- Because of the way generics work, we cannot create a collection of primitives types. 
-  For example, Set<int> does not work. However, ints have an Integer wrapper we can use (e.g. `Set<Integer> numbers`).
-  In order to make it easier to use collections of these wrapper types, Java does some automatic conversion. If we have declared `List<Integer> sequence`, this code works:
```
// wrap 5 as an Integer object, and append it to the sequence
sequence.add(5);              
 // get the second Integer element, and unwrap it into an int
int second = sequence.get(1);
```

**ArrayLists and LinkedLists: creating Lists**
- Specification of the type: what does it do? 
- Implementation: what is the code? 
  
<br>List, Set, and Map are all interfaces: 
- They define how these respective types work,
- but they don't provide implementation code. 
- One potential advantange of this is that we, the users of these types, get to choose different implementations in different situations.

<br>Here's how to create some actual Lists: 
<br>`List<String> firstNames = new ArrayList<String>();`
<br>`List<String> lastNames = new LinkedList<String>();`
<br>If the *generic type parameters* are the same on the left and right, Java can infer what's going on and save us some typing:
<br>`List<String> firstNames = new ArrayList<>();`
<br>`List<String> lastNames = new LinkedList<String>();`
- ArrayList and LinkedList are two *implementations* of List.
- Both provide all the operations of *List*.
- Both will behave the same way. 
- If we swapped which one used ArrayList vs. LinkedList, our code will not break. 
- The only difference is performance: 
  - They differ in their underlying implementation and performance characteristics. 
  ```
  Feature	               ArrayList	  LinkedList
  Data Structure	         Array	    Doubly Linked List
  Add/Remove(Middle)	     O(n)	        O(1)
  Add/Remove(Start/End)	   O(1)	        O(1)
  Random Access	           O(1)	        O(n)
  Memory Usage	           Lower	    Higher
  ```
<br>In summary:
- ArrayList is a good choice for general-purpose lists where you need a balance between access speed and modification operations. 
- LinkedList is ideal for scenarios where frequent insertions/removals are essential even if sacrificing some random access speed and memory efficiency.
- When in doubt, use ArrayList.

<br>Initialize an ArrayList or LinkedList in one go: 
```
List<String> firstNames = new ArrayList<>(List.of("Huey", "Dewey", "Louie"));
List<String> lastNames = new ArrayList<>(Set.of("Duck));
```
- `List.of()` produces an immutable list, `new ArrayList<>(List.of())` produces a mutable list, if you need a mutable list, this is simpler than making mutiple calls to `add()`.
