# 1.1 Basic Programming Model
This chapter introduces the basic tools that we need to study algorithms and data structures.

First, we introduce our basic programming model:
- Section 1.1 is a summary of
language constructs, features, and libraries that we use in this book.
- We emphasize data abstraction, where we define abstract data types (ADTs) in
the service of modular programming.

- Section 1.2 we introduce the process of implementing an ADT in Java, by specifying an applications programming interface (API)
and then using the Java class mechanism to develop an implementation for use in client
code.

We can define an algorithm by describing a procedure for solving a problem in a
natural language, or by writing a computer program that implements the procedure,
as shown at right for Euclidâ€™s algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two
numbers.

We should not use an algorithm without having an idea of what resources it might consume, so we strive to be aware of how our algorithms might be expected to perform.
