## Algorithms I 

The book is intended to follow our introductory text, Computer
Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach, which is a broad introduction to the field. To-
gether, these two books can support a two- or three-semester introduction to computer
science that will give any student the requisite background to successfully address com-
putation in any chosen field of study in science, engineering, or the social sciences.
The starting point for much of the material in the book was the Sedgewick series of
Algorithms books. In spirit, this book is closest to the first and second editions of that
book, but this text benefits from decades of experience teaching and learning that ma-
terial. Sedgewick’s current Algorithms in C/C++/Java, Third Edition is more appropri-
ate as a reference or a text for an advanced course; this book is specifically designed to
be a textbook for a one-semester course for first- or second-year college students and as
a modern introduction to the basics and a reference for use by working programmers


 This set of topics is intended to touch on as many fundamental algorithms as
possible. Some of the areas covered are core computer-science areas that we study in
depth to learn basic algorithms of wide applicability. Other algorithms that we discuss
are from advanced fields of study within computer science and related fields. (book)

**Chapter 1:** 
Fundamentals introduces a scientific and engineering basis for comparing algorithms and making predictions. It also includes our programming model.

Fundamentals (Chapter 1) in the context of this book are the basic principles and
methodology that we use to implement, analyze, and compare algorithms. We consider
our Java programming model, data abstraction, basic data structures, abstract data
types for collections, methods of analyzing algorithm performance, and a case study

**Chapter 2:** 
Sorting considers several classic sorting algorithms, including insertion sort, mergesort, and quicksort. It also features a binary heap implementation of a priority queue.

**Chapter 3:**
Searching describes several classic symbol-table implementations, including binary search trees, red–black trees, and hash tables.

**Chapter 4:** 
Graphs surveys the most important graph-processing problems, including depth-first search, breadth-first search, minimum spanning trees, and shortest paths.

**Chapter 5:** 
Strings investigates specialized algorithms for string processing, including radix sorting, substring search, tries, regular expressions, and data compression.

**Chapter 6:** 
Context highlights connections to systems programming, scientific computing, commercial applications, operations research, and intractability.
