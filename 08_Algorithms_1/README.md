## Algorithms I 

**Chapter 1:** 
Fundamentals introduces a scientific and engineering basis for comparing algorithms and making predictions. It also includes our programming model.

**Chapter 2:** 
Sorting considers several classic sorting algorithms, including insertion sort, mergesort, and quicksort. It also features a binary heap implementation of a priority queue.

**Chapter 3:**
Searching describes several classic symbol-table implementations, including binary search trees, red–black trees, and hash tables.

**Chapter 4:** 
Graphs surveys the most important graph-processing problems, including depth-first search, breadth-first search, minimum spanning trees, and shortest paths.

**Chapter 5:** 
Strings investigates specialized algorithms for string processing, including radix sorting, substring search, tries, regular expressions, and data compression.

**Chapter 6:** 
Context highlights connections to systems programming, scientific computing, commercial applications, operations research, and intractability.
